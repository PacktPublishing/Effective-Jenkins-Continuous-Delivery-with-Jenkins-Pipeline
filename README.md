This is the code repository for [Effective Jenkins: Continuous Delivery with Jenkins Pipeline [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/effective-jenkins-continuous-delivery-jenkins-pipeline-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788477710), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Jenkins is one of the most popular Continuous Integration servers because it is an open source project and a very flexible tool, which you can easily use to automate all the steps in your software delivery process on any platform.

This course is designed to give you a foundation in the concepts of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, and implementing them with Jenkins. It will show you how to set up your CI environment, by installing and configuring Jenkins Master/Nodes, introducing the main parts of the tool, and effectively configuring Jenkins projects to build and test a software application. 

In this first volume, you will understand the key concepts of CI, as well Continuous Deployment. Next, we get started with Jenkins by installing and configuring a Master and Node server. Once this is done, you will understand the main parts of Jenkins and create different types of Jenkins projects to automate everything that you want. We finish the section by looking at a Java web project and creating the necessary steps to build and test it, thereby empowering you to implement it in a real project.
